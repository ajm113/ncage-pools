# N. Cage Pool Supplies

*Welcome to N. Cage Pools. Well, Baby-O, it's not exactly mai-thais
and yatzee out here but... let's do it!*

## Quick Setup

All you need to do to run this project is run `vagrant up` and pop open your browser to [92.168.33.15](http://192.168.33.15) when it's finished.

If you don't have Vagrant installed, I can't help you, but these awesome [website](https://www.vagrantup.com/) can!
