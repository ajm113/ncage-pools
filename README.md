# N. Cage Pool Supplies

*Welcome to N. Cage Pools. I haven't made anything I don't believe in. I've always started a project 
with a framework in my heart, and even when I'm a little unclear about it, something magical happens and it comes 
into focus in a way that I'm feeling good about.*

## Setup

All you need to do to run this project is run `vagrant up` and pop open your browser to [92.168.33.15](http://192.168.33.15) when it's finished.

If you don't have Vagrant installed, I can't help you.
